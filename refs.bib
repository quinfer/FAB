Although prevention technologies are the best way to reduce fraud, fraudsters are adaptive and, given time, will usually find ways to circumvent such measures. Methodologies for the detection of fraud are essential if we are to catch fraudsters once fraud prevention has failed. Statistics and machine learning provide effective technologies for fraud detection and have been applied successfully to detect activities such as money laundering, e-commerce credit card fraud, telecommunications fraud and computer intrusion, to name but a few. We describe the tools available for statistical fraud detection and the areas in which fraud detection technologies are most used.}},

abstract = {{We design an adaptive framework for the detection of illegal trading behavior. Its key component is an extension of a pattern recognition tool, originating from the field of signal processing and adapted to modern electronic systems of securities trading. The new method combines the flexibility of dynamic time warping with contemporary approaches from extreme value theory to explore large-scale transaction data and accurately identify illegal trading patterns. Importantly, our method does not need access to any confirmed illegal transactions for training. We use a high-frequency order book dataset provided by an international investment firm to show that the method achieves remarkable improvements over alternative approaches in the identification of suspected illegal insider trading cases.}},

To understand the drivers of these extreme cancellation rates, we develop a simple model of liquidity provision and find that growth in order-to-trade ratios (OTTRs) is driven by fragmentation of trading and technological improvements that lower monitoring costs. High OTTRs occur legitimately in stocks with high volatility, fragmented trading, small tick sizes, and low volume. OTTRs are usually within levels consistent with market making, but occasionally spike to levels that may indicate illegitimate trading such as spoofing.}},

We examine these cases using a visualization method developed in particle physics (CERN) and the messages that the exchange receives about market activity rather than time‐based snapshots. This approach allows to examine multiple indicators related to market manipulation and complement existing research methods, thereby enhancing the identification and understanding of, as well as the motivation for, market manipulation. In the JPMorgan cases, we offer an alternative motivation for spoofing than moving the price.}},
