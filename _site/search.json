    "text": "Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) Keynote\n\n\n\nPavle Avramovic (Manager of Emerging Tech and Research in Innovation Department of the FCA)\n\n\nSo, let’s dive into the “Emerging Technologies & Regulation” keynote, a real brain-teaser that digs into the tricky dance between cutting-edge tech and keeping things above board with regulators. First off, it throws a spotlight on how key it is for regulatory bodies, like the big players at the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA), to understand new tech. The FCA’s Innovation department is right at the heart of this, juggling the task of getting these newfangled technologies to play nice with the rules.\nNow, getting into the weeds, the presentation takes a deep dive into synthetic data and Privacy Enhancing Technologies (PETs) – emerging solutions to some wicked problems in the finance world. These are the secret sauce for keeping our data safe and sound, a issues that is front and centre as the FCA grapple with Big Tech as the gatekeepers of our financial data. The FCA isn’t just sitting on its hands either; they’ve got this Horizon Scanning Framework, a nifty tool for keeping an eye out on how tech trends could shake up the financial scene for businesses and us regular folks.\nBut wait, the weeds get more complex. We get into the nitty-gritty of some real mind-bending tech like Quantum Computing and Decentralized Finance (DeFi). The talk’s all about figuring out how these innovations could stir the pot and the headaches they might cause for the rule books. The FCA isn’t just watching from the sidelines - they’re right in there, working with all sorts to make sure innovation gets a green light while still keeping things square for us and the market.\nPlus, the presentation doesn’t just stop at the now; it takes a peek into what’s coming. It lays out the FCA’s game plan for rolling these tech wonders into their rule-making playbook. It’s all about teaming up and staying nimble, making sure the rules can keep up with the tech without putting the brakes on new ideas. At FAB, we are excited about the follow-on action points in this space.\nIn a nutshell, this talk gives you the whole picture of how tech, money, and rules are doing this intricate tango, highlighting why we need to stay sharp ,and research in collaboration with regulators and businesses, to keep things moving in the right direction.\nFull slide deck can be found here"

    "text": "Academic Presentation\n Alright, let’s switch gears to Professor Wang’s presentation on “AI and Compliance Audit”. As a professor of AI, Hui dives deep into the techy side of using AI in making sure everyone’s playing by the rules in auditing. We’re talking about some technologies that AI brings to this wicked problem.\nFirst up, there’s advances in Natural Language Processing (NLP). This isn’t your everyday chattty AI; it’s like giving a super-brain the ability to chew through complex legal jargon and regulations. A machine that can potentially make sense of all that legal “rules on the book” using logic-based algorithms.\nThen, comes the machine learning algorithms,the kind that can spot the odd one out in heaps of data. These clever algorithms are like detectives, sniffing out anything fishy that might point to someone bending the rules.\nAnd don’t forget about Computer Vision. This isn’t just about giving computers eyes; it’s about teaching them to be eagle-eyed when it comes to scanning documents and images. They’re making sure every ‘i’ is dotted and every ‘t’ is crossed for compliance.\nBut,it’s not all about the gushy AI hype. The presentation doesn’t shy away from the tough bits, like making sure the data’s up to scratch and keeping the AI’s decision-making clear as day. Plus, there’s the big question of ethics – how do we use AI without stepping on privacy toes or shaking up jobs in the auditing world?\nIn short, Professor Wang’s talk is a deep dive into the cool, complex world of AI in compliance auditing, blending the high-tech with the high-stakes of keeping things on the straight and narrow.\nFull slide deck can be found here\n\n\n\nProfessor Daniel Broby (Ulster Business School)\n\n\nDaniel’s presentation tackled the topic of “Financial Auditing of Distributed Ledgers, Blockchain, and Cryptocurrencies”. This one’s a real eye-opener, diving into the twisty world of auditing in the age of blockchain and crypto.\nDaniel kicks off with transaction malleability in the blockchain. It sounds like a mouthful, but think of it as the art of making sure each transaction is what it claims to be, even when the blockchain’s being a bit slippery.\nNext, he moves onto the Wild West of Digital Autonomous Organizations (DAOs). Auditing these bad boys is like trying to herd cats (or academics!), with their decentralised, headless nature throwing up all sorts of challenges.\nThen there’s the melodrama of blockchain forks. Imagine auditing a road that suddenly splits in two – which path do you take? Daniel discusses the auditors’ headaches when the blockchain decides to go this way and that.\nAuditors in blockchain custody is another hot topic. In this new world, auditors are like the blockchain’s guardians, making sure everything’s above board and secure. Cross-chain transactions are wicked problem in this space. It’s like auditing a deal that happens across multiple countries, each with its own rules. How do you even start to keep track of all that? Do the theories of international finance help here?\nDaniel doesn’t stop there. He dives into the nitty-gritty of time-locked and multi-signature transactions, like those puzzles where you need two keys to open a treasure chest. And let’s not forget the rollercoaster ride that is cryptocurrency volatility. This stuff makes auditing a whole new ball game.\nDaniel’s talk is a deep dive into the new frontier of financial auditing. It’s a world where everything’s digital, decentralised, and a bit unpredictable, highlighting just how much auditors need to up their game to keep up with these techy trends.\nThe full slide deck can be found here"

Picture this: some of the brightest sparks from Northern Ireland’s buzzing private sector, all gathered to share their two cents. We had the big brains like Pavle Avramovic, who’s into Emerging Tech & Research at the FCA; Chris Clements, the whiz behind Product Development at FinTrU; Dr Adrian Johnston MBE, the strategic mastermind at Catalyst; and Carla McGlynn, the guru of Data, Business Risks, and Controls Technology at Citi Belfast. Leading this dream team was Dr Fearghal Kearney, and he wasn’t messing about – he hit them with two big questions:\n\nWhat’s the score with AI in Financial Services? What golden opportunities can Northern Ireland grab with both hands?\nAnd the flip side – what are the big risks and headaches of mixing AI into Financial Services?\n\nThe debate that kicked off was nothing short of lively. Adrian chipped in with his take on the top-notch research and innovation collabs already happening in Northern Ireland, not to mention some exciting prospects brewing up in the North West. When it came to the nitty-gritty of risks and challenges, Chris was on point, stressing how we’ve got to stop working in our own little bubbles. And Dr Kearney, the chair, had a cracker of a point – it’s high time for Data Scientists to stop lurking in the corner of the playground.\nCarla dropped a gem too, reminding everyone that sometimes what we need from AI can be pretty straightforward, like getting those never-ending documents summed up for the busy bees at the top. All in all, it was a top-shelf discussion that really got the cogs turning on how Northern Ireland can play its cards right with AI in the financial game."

However, when evaluating new technologies like algorithms and AI, our traditional productivity metrics often come up short (Wilson, Daugherty, and Morini-Bianzino 2021).\nOn the surface, these technologies seem like automation tools to drive efficiency. However, as MIT research has shown, the real power of AI is its ability to uncover hidden insights and make broad improvements across entire systems (Chui, Henke, and Miremadi 2018).

    "text": "The academic take\n\nThe paper proposes a new multi-objective portfolio optimisation model for large-scale investments involving both long-term listed securities (with sufficient historical return data) and newly listed securities (with limited return data). The model uses mean, variance, and skewness of returns as objectives and incorporates practical trading constraints.\nThe returns of long-term securities are treated as random variables, while returns of new securities are modeled as uncertain variables estimated by experts. The concept of uncertain random variables is used to jointly model the randomness and uncertainty.\nTo solve the complex constrained optimisation model, the paper develops an encoder-decoder method to convert it into an unconstrained model. This allows arbitrary multi-objective algorithms to be applied.\nA novel large-scale multi-objective evolutionary algorithm (LSWOEA) is proposed, using techniques like decision space reduction and a dispersed target-guided search strategy. Experiments show LSWOEA outperforms other state-of-the-art algorithms.\nThe proposed model and LSWOEA algorithm effectively handles portfolio optimisation problems with up to 1000 securities. This advances the field of computational finance and enables large-scale portfolio management for practical applications.\nOverall, the paper makes significant research contributions in modeling large-scale portfolio optimisation under uncertainty, developing specialised algorithms, and demonstrating superior performance on problems with hundreds of assets. This pushes the boundaries of portfolio optimisation and evolutionary computation."

This hybrid approach reflects real-world data limitations.\nThe proposed optimisation algorithm can efficiently handle portfolios with hundreds or thousands of assets, overcoming computational barriers facing large institutional investors.\nTests show the algorithm consistently finds better optimal portfolios compared to existing methods, demonstrating value for practitioners.\nCapability to optimise very large portfolios allows diversification across more assets, which can potentially improve risk-adjusted returns.\nFor asset managers, employing these advanced techniques could lead to better portfolio construction versus traditional methods, improving outcomes for institutional clients.\nOverall, this research represents an important step towards effective large-scale portfolio optimisation for institutional investors, bringing academic advances closer to practice."

It analyzes historical accounting data to benchmark a firm’s efficiency in converting inputs into financial outputs (Siegel 2020).\nMeanwhile, operational research employs granular operational metrics like utilization rates, throughput, and defect rates (Foster 2022). It focuses on optimizing the operations and processes that transform resources into products and services."

    "text": "Which Approach Is Better for Evaluating AI Productivity?\nWhen analyzing new technologies like AI, operations research techniques have clear advantages (Agrawal, Gans, and Goldfarb 2021). That’s because AI’s benefits manifest indirectly through enhancements to decision making, risk reduction, quality improvements, and innovation. These are complex, system-level effects not capturable by the linear corporate finance models underpinning traditional productivity metrics (Hulten 2021).\nIn contrast, an operations research approach can account for AI’s full range of returns (Brynjolfsson 2022). By benchmarking against multi-dimensional best practice frontiers, operations research can quantify the process enhancements, increased automation, reduced waste, and improved worker output achieved by AI adoption. This technical productivity measurement aligns with how AI creates organizational value - via engineering, not just financial returns."

    "text": "The Need for New Metrics\nReturning to our original example, let’s see how this applies. A new predictive maintenance algorithm may slightly slow a production line. By traditional productivity measures focused on volume and speed, it scores poorly. But by reducing downstream disruptions and failures, it better optimises the entire supply chain - a benefit that standard metrics miss. As analysts at McKinsey have pointed out, new AI recruiting tools may take more upfront time to implement than prior systems (Bughin et al. 2021). But by surfacing better candidates, they drive dramatic improvements in quality and retention that pay dividends over years.\nIn short, multiple research studies have shown that applying conventional productivity lenses often underestimates the gains AI can drive (Agrawal, Gans, and Goldfarb 2021). While efficiency benchmarks have their place, they insufficiently measure AI’s systemic, widespread improvements that raise overall performance. To capture its true value, productivity metrics must become more holistic. Rather than just simplistic speed and volume counts, we need multidimensional measures that account for enhanced decision making, reduced risk, higher quality, better experiences, and increased innovation, as researchers at Stanford have suggested (Cockburn, Henderson, and Stern 2018).\nOnly with better metrics can we escape the illusion that algorithms and AI are merely automation tools (Wilson, Daugherty, and Morini-Bianzino 2021). In reality, their indirect, higher-order benefits make them drivers of progress unmatched by any productivity-enhancing technology we have adopted in decades. But we cannot manage and optimise what we do not measure. As stewards of progress, we must develop metrics as innovative and far-reaching as the technologies we aim to implement."
