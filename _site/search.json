    "text": "The Fox Paradox and AI:\nThe Fox Paradox, while not explicitly referring to AI, presents a crucial theoretical lens for understanding productivity in the AI era. It highlights the potential discrepancies between efficiency gains in individual components and overall system performance (Fox 1999; Färe and Grosskopf 2004). Several key aspects of the Fox Paradox manifest in AI-driven systems:\n\nNon-linear effects: AI disrupts the linear input-output relationships assumed by traditional productivity metrics. Its capacity for self-learning and process optimisation can drive significant gains without proportional increases in measurable inputs (Brynjolfsson and McAfee 2014). Focusing solely on marginal productivity changes may overlook the transformative potential of AI.\nThe intangibles conundrum: AI excels in generating knowledge-based, creative, and decision-making outputs that are difficult to quantify using standard ratio analysis. Focusing solely on easily measurable domains risks undervaluing AI’s true productivity impact (Acemoglu and Restrepo 2018).\nNetwork effects and resource dynamics: AI-driven optimisations can create complex network effects where the productivity of the whole system exceeds the sum of its parts (Manyika et al. 2017). Traditional metrics may fail to capture these externalities. Moreover, AI-induced resource shifts, such as the reallocation of capital and skilled labour, can create imbalances that hamper overall productivity."

The AI generates additional ideas, but they are weighted lower due to the AI’s lack of contextual understanding. The overall efficiency increases due to AI assistance.\nThe code demonstrates how traditional metrics focused on idea quantity may indicate improved productivity in the AI-assisted scenario. However, this view risks overlooking the potential innovation blindspot arising from the reduced human idea generation and the AI’s limited contextual understanding.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportant\n\n\n\nThis example illustrates how the Fox Paradox can manifest in AI-driven innovation processes. While AI may boost apparent productivity by increasing the total number of ideas generated, it may also introduce blindspots by discouraging human creativity and generating ideas lacking contextual relevance. Productivity metrics that fail to account for these nuances may paint an incomplete picture of AI’s true impact on innovation."

The function takes the input quantities and their respective output elasticities (alpha, beta, and gamma) as parameters.\nThe calculate_productivity function calculates the productivity by dividing the total output by the sum of the input quantities (labour, capital, and AI).\nIn Scenario 1, production is modelled without AI input (ai_1 = 0). The output and productivity are calculated based on the given labour and capital inputs.\nIn Scenario 2, production is modelled with an AI input (ai_2 = 10). The AI input is initially difficult to quantify but is expected to contribute to the output. The output and productivity are calculated considering the labour, capital, and AI inputs.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportant\n\n\n\nInterpretation: - In Scenario 1 (without AI), the output is approximately 70.71, and the productivity is 1, indicating that the output is proportional to the geometric mean of the inputs. - In Scenario 2 (with AI), the output is approximately 89.02, and the productivity is around 1.12, suggesting that the inclusion of AI has increased the output and productivity compared to Scenario 1."

    "text": "Practical Implications and the Need for Adaptive Metrics:\nThe Fox Paradox underscores several practical challenges in measuring AI productivity:\n\nInnovation blindspots: An overemphasis on quantifiable inputs and outputs may obscure AI’s potential to drive non-incremental, transformative innovation. Novel products, services, and business models enabled by AI might be poorly reflected in traditional analyses (Solow 1987).\nEvolving skillsets: As AI automates routine tasks, the demand for human capital shifts towards cognitive and socio-emotional skills. Productivity metrics must incorporate the value and development of these “intangible” worker capabilities to accurately assess AI’s workforce impact (Autor 2015).\nGovernance and ethics: AI-driven decision-making raises important questions about accountability, bias, and the equitable distribution of productivity gains. Metrics that neglect these ethical dimensions risk exacerbating inequalities and creating perverse incentives (Mittelstadt et al. 2016).\n\nTo address these challenges, organisations need adaptive measurement frameworks that: - Account for AI’s non-linear, system-level effects - Capture the value of intangible outputs and worker skills - Incorporate governance and ethical considerations - Align metrics with strategic objectives beyond short-term efficiency"

    "section": "Conclusion",
    "text": "Conclusion\nThe Fox Paradox serves as a powerful reminder that the advent of AI demands a rethinking of productivity measurement. Traditional metrics, while still useful, provide an incomplete picture when applied to AI-driven systems. To effectively harness AI’s potential, organisations must develop holistic, adaptive frameworks that capture its distinct value creation mechanisms and broader socio-technical implications.\nThe coded examples in this post illustrate the limitations of conventional productivity analysis in the context of AI. They highlight the need for new approaches that account for AI’s non-linear effects, intangible outputs, and potential misalignments between individual and system-wide efficiency. By adopting a more comprehensive view of productivity, organisations can make informed decisions about AI deployment and avoid the pitfalls of the Fox Paradox.\nFurthermore, the theoretical illustration using the Cobb-Douglas production function demonstrates how AI inputs, even when initially difficult to quantify, can lead to improved output and productivity. It emphasises the importance of developing new methods to measure AI’s contribution to production processes and refining estimates of its output elasticity over time.\nAs organisations navigate the AI era, they must embrace adaptive productivity metrics that align with the transformative potential of this technology. By doing so, they can steer AI towards equitable, sustainable progress and unlock its full value for businesses and society as a whole. Only by evolving our productivity thinking can we harness the power of AI while mitigating the risks highlighted by the Fox Paradox."

    "text": "The academic take\n\nThe paper proposes a new multi-objective portfolio optimisation model for large-scale investments involving both long-term listed securities (with sufficient historical return data) and newly listed securities (with limited return data). The model uses mean, variance, and skewness of returns as objectives and incorporates practical trading constraints.\nThe returns of long-term securities are treated as random variables, while returns of new securities are modeled as uncertain variables estimated by experts. The concept of uncertain random variables is used to jointly model the randomness and uncertainty.\nTo solve the complex constrained optimisation model, the paper develops an encoder-decoder method to convert it into an unconstrained model. This allows arbitrary multi-objective algorithms to be applied.\nA novel large-scale multi-objective evolutionary algorithm (LSWOEA) is proposed, using techniques like decision space reduction and a dispersed target-guided search strategy. Experiments show LSWOEA outperforms other state-of-the-art algorithms.\nThe proposed model and LSWOEA algorithm effectively handles portfolio optimisation problems with up to 1000 securities. This advances the field of computational finance and enables large-scale portfolio management for practical applications.\nOverall, the paper makes significant research contributions in modeling large-scale portfolio optimisation under uncertainty, developing specialised algorithms, and demonstrating superior performance on problems with hundreds of assets. This pushes the boundaries of portfolio optimisation and evolutionary computation."

    "text": "How AI is Revolutionising Finance Education 🥷📈\nLet’s be honest, chaps and chapettes – the traditional finance education experience feels about as cutting-edge as a telex machine. Think dense lectures delivered by professors who haven’t updated their syllabus since the pound sterling was backed by gold (bless their dusty ledgers). Students get buried in data analysis, feeling like financial spelunkers lost amidst a monstrous spreadsheet. But fear not, weary educators and bewildered students! The cavalry has arrived, and it’s wielding not cavalry sabres, but the powerful twin steeds of educational research and artificial intelligence.\nLearning Like You Haven’t Got a Looming Deadline (Because You Won’t Need One Anymore)\nA recent study from the mathematical education area sheds light on how we can ditch the all-nighters and actually retain knowledge. Here’s the lowdown for your finance students (and maybe a refresher for some of our more…tenured instructors):\n\nDitch the Cramming: Massed practice (think pre-exam panic) may be the norm, but spaced repetition is way more effective. Spread out learning complex financial concepts and data analysis techniques, and watch your students’ understanding soar (without the caffeine shakes).\nChill Out, Quant Crunchers: Turns out, pressure actually hinders performance. Create a relaxed environment where students feel comfortable asking questions, experimenting with data sets, and even making the odd blunder (without facing the wrath of Professor Briarwood).\nActive Learning is Active Mastery: Passive lectures are the financial equivalent of watching a snooker match on mute. Engage your students with case studies, simulations, and group projects that involve actively applying their data analysis skills to real-world financial problems. Think “Dragon’s Den” meets “Moneyball” – minus the entrepreneurial shouting matches.\n\nEnter Your AI Teaching Sidekick: No Fancy Title Needed 🤖\nLarge Language Models (LLMs) aren’t here to replace you, Professor Peabody! Imagine having an AI assistant that can:\n\nPersonalise Finance Learning: LLMs can tailor explanations to each student’s needs, bridging knowledge gaps and accelerating understanding. Think of it as a bespoke Savile Row suit for learning, minus the exorbitant cost.\nBecome a Practice Partner: Virtual AI assistants can engage students in practice sessions, providing real-time feedback on their analysis and decision-making. No more endless office hours spent grading practice problems – let the AI handle the repetitive bits!\nCraft Assessments with Ease: Let AI help you design quizzes, exams, and project prompts that accurately assess students’ mastery of data analysis in a finance context. This frees you up for lively seminars and personalised feedback sessions instead.\n\nIndustry Collaboration: Because the City Doesn’t Have Midterms 🤝\nThe future of finance education isn’t built in an ivory tower – it’s forged in partnership with the industry itself. Here’s how to create a win-win scenario for all involved:\n\nGuest Lectures from the Trading Floor: Invite industry practitioners to discuss real-world applications of AI in finance. Let your students hear from the folks who are using these tools to make investment decisions, manage risk, and (hopefully) not cause another financial meltdown.\nIndustry-Informed Projects: Collaborate with financial firms to develop datasets and project briefs based on their current challenges. This gives students an authentic taste of what they’ll be tackling after graduation, minus the pressure of having their bonuses depend on their performance (for now).\nInternships with an AI Focus: Facilitate internships where students get hands-on experience with the specific AI tools used in finance. This not only adds some sparkle to their CVs, but also helps the industry identify and nurture the next generation of data-savvy financial whizzes.\n\nThe Future of Finance Education: No More Dusty Ledgers, Just Data Ninjas\nThis isn’t about replacing educators; it’s about arming them with the latest research and cutting-edge tools. By combining proven learning techniques with AI assistance and fostering industry partnerships, we can create a new generation of highly skilled financial data analysts who are ready to tackle the ever-evolving challenges of the financial world. So, fellow educators, are you ready to ditch the tweed jacket (optional) and embrace the future, or will your students be left behind, clinging to their calculators like a life raft in a sea of big data?\n\nStay tuned for part two soon!"

First off, it throws a spotlight on how key it is for regulatory bodies, like the big players at the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA), to understand new tech. The FCA’s Innovation department is right at the heart of this, juggling the task of getting these newfangled technologies to play nice with the rules.\nNow, getting into the weeds, the presentation takes a deep dive into synthetic data and Privacy Enhancing Technologies (PETs) – emerging solutions to some wicked problems in the finance world. These are the secret sauce for keeping our data safe and sound, a issues that is front and centre as the FCA grapple with Big Tech as the gatekeepers of our financial data. The FCA isn’t just sitting on its hands either; they’ve got this Horizon Scanning Framework, a nifty tool for keeping an eye out on how tech trends could shake up the financial scene for businesses and us regular folks.\nBut wait, the weeds get more complex. We get into the nitty-gritty of some real mind-bending tech like Quantum Computing and Decentralized Finance (DeFi). The talk’s all about figuring out how these innovations could stir the pot and the headaches they might cause for the rule books. The FCA isn’t just watching from the sidelines - they’re right in there, working with all sorts to make sure innovation gets a green light while still keeping things square for us and the market.\nPlus, the presentation doesn’t just stop at the now; it takes a peek into what’s coming. It lays out the FCA’s game plan for rolling these tech wonders into their rule-making playbook. It’s all about teaming up and staying nimble, making sure the rules can keep up with the tech without putting the brakes on new ideas. At FAB, we are excited about the follow-on action points in this space.\nIn a nutshell, this talk gives you the whole picture of how tech, money, and rules are doing this intricate tango, highlighting why we need to stay sharp ,and research in collaboration with regulators and businesses, to keep things moving in the right direction.\nFull slide deck can be found here"

    "text": "Academic Presentation\n Alright, let’s switch gears to Professor Wang’s presentation on “AI and Compliance Audit”. As a professor of AI, Hui dives deep into the techy side of using AI in making sure everyone’s playing by the rules in auditing. We’re talking about some technologies that AI brings to this wicked problem.\nFirst up, there’s advances in Natural Language Processing (NLP). This isn’t your everyday chattty AI; it’s like giving a super-brain the ability to chew through complex legal jargon and regulations. A machine that can potentially make sense of all that legal “rules on the book” using logic-based algorithms.\nThen, comes the machine learning algorithms,the kind that can spot the odd one out in heaps of data. These clever algorithms are like detectives, sniffing out anything fishy that might point to someone bending the rules.\nAnd don’t forget about Computer Vision. This isn’t just about giving computers eyes; it’s about teaching them to be eagle-eyed when it comes to scanning documents and images. They’re making sure every ‘i’ is dotted and every ‘t’ is crossed for compliance.\nBut,it’s not all about the gushy AI hype. The presentation doesn’t shy away from the tough bits, like making sure the data’s up to scratch and keeping the AI’s decision-making clear as day. Plus, there’s the big question of ethics – how do we use AI without stepping on privacy toes or shaking up jobs in the auditing world?\nIn short, Professor Wang’s talk is a deep dive into the cool, complex world of AI in compliance auditing, blending the high-tech with the high-stakes of keeping things on the straight and narrow.\nFull slide deck can be found here\n\n\n\nProfessor Daniel Broby (Ulster Business School)\n\n\nDaniel’s presentation tackled the topic of “Financial Auditing of Distributed Ledgers, Blockchain, and Cryptocurrencies”. This one’s a real eye-opener, diving into the twisty world of auditing in the age of blockchain and crypto.\nDaniel kicks off with transaction malleability in the blockchain. It sounds like a mouthful, but think of it as the art of making sure each transaction is what it claims to be, even when the blockchain’s being a bit slippery.\nNext, he moves onto the Wild West of Digital Autonomous Organizations (DAOs). Auditing these bad boys is like trying to herd cats (or academics!), with their decentralised, headless nature throwing up all sorts of challenges.\nThen there’s the melodrama of blockchain forks. Imagine auditing a road that suddenly splits in two – which path do you take? Daniel discusses the auditors’ headaches when the blockchain decides to go this way and that.\nAuditors in blockchain custody is another hot topic. In this new world, auditors are like the blockchain’s guardians, making sure everything’s above board and secure. Cross-chain transactions are wicked problem in this space. It’s like auditing a deal that happens across multiple countries, each with its own rules. How do you even start to keep track of all that? Do the theories of international finance help here?\nDaniel doesn’t stop there. He dives into the nitty-gritty of time-locked and multi-signature transactions, like those puzzles where you need two keys to open a treasure chest. And let’s not forget the rollercoaster ride that is cryptocurrency volatility. This stuff makes auditing a whole new ball game.\nDaniel’s talk is a deep dive into the new frontier of financial auditing. It’s a world where everything’s digital, decentralised, and a bit unpredictable, highlighting just how much auditors need to up their game to keep up with these techy trends.\nThe full slide deck can be found here"

Picture this: some of the brightest sparks from Northern Ireland’s buzzing private sector, all gathered to share their two cents. We had the big brains like Pavle Avramovic, who’s into Emerging Tech & Research at the FCA; Chris Clements, the whiz behind Product Development at FinTrU; Dr Adrian Johnston MBE, the strategic mastermind at Catalyst; and Carla McGlynn, the guru of Data, Business Risks, and Controls Technology at Citi Belfast. Leading this dream team was Dr Fearghal Kearney, and he wasn’t messing about – he hit them with two big questions:\n\nWhat’s the score with AI in Financial Services? What golden opportunities can Northern Ireland grab with both hands?\nAnd the flip side – what are the big risks and headaches of mixing AI into Financial Services?\n\nThe debate that kicked off was nothing short of lively. Adrian chipped in with his take on the top-notch research and innovation collabs already happening in Northern Ireland, not to mention some exciting prospects brewing up in the North West. When it came to the nitty-gritty of risks and challenges, Chris was on point, stressing how we’ve got to stop working in our own little bubbles. And Dr Kearney, the chair, had a cracker of a point – it’s high time for Data Scientists to stop lurking in the corner of the playground.\nCarla dropped a gem too, reminding everyone that sometimes what we need from AI can be pretty straightforward, like getting those never-ending documents summed up for the busy bees at the top. All in all, it was a top-shelf discussion that really got the cogs turning on how Northern Ireland can play its cards right with AI in the financial game."
