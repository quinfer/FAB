## Mission

The mission is to bridge gaps between information technologies, data science, innovation, and financial decision-making. Our goal is to be a global lab of excellence, uniquely located at the gateway between the UK, and the EU. To achieve this mission the lab has the following strategic goals:

1.  Be a world leader in technology focused research for compliance and regulation.[^2]

2.  Actively co-produce academic output with industry partners.

3.  Strengthen and develop linkages with School of Electronics, Electrical Engineering and Computer Science.[^3]

4.  Foster national and international partnerships with other research labs in financial technology and data science.

5.  Nuclei local fintech companies to inform disruptive research in technology adoption in finance.

Since 2015, it has been identified as a strategic priority for the UK financial services sector (<https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/fintech-blackett-review>). Barry Quinn is the QUB academic lead for a corporate spending review bid to build a global centre for secure and connected regulatory technologies in Northern Ireland (project start date mid 2023)
