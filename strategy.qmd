A key strategic goal for FAB is to enhance and develop multidisciplinary research through strong links with GII/[CSIT](http://www.csit.qub.ac.uk). The lab is well positioned provide domain knowledge transfer to the BRCD funded Momentum One Zero Institute in Queen's. The following diagram highlights expertise linkages (regulatory technology expertise is highlighted in orange):
